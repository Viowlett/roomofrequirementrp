<p>From a seasoned RP Idiot Here are some tips from me (a long standing DM and online roleplayer of many years and fandoms) trying to help you (hopefully someone who is into RP, or else disregard this message) 
    
    <ol>
    <li> <h4>Character Building</h4></li>
        <ul>
            <li>When building a character, best practice is to make sure your other OC(s) have already had time to grow and develop to prevent RP fatigue.</li>
            <li>If you're not sure how "canon" your character must be - assume they need to be 100% compliant, then work backwards. This is considered polite. Ask what the standard of canon being upheld is. If you want to do something off-canon, ask a mod. People will generally assume all players are going from the canon unless otherwise stated. Usually, you can ask people in a community to help you.</li>
            <li>Tragic backstories are useful, but when building a character: check with a mod what a server / group allows. Some backstories may be too "heavy" for the room.
            <li>Tone is important. A character coming in and being a crack character / funny character will limit you immensely when you get deeper into RP. Ask what the tone is, if you're not sure.</li>
            <li> Don't build a character just to fill another character's arc in serious RP without giving them a fleshed-out personality / traits. It's a bit tasteless. </li>
        </ul>

    <li><h4>Relationships</h4></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Always check with a player what your character's relationship is to them and agree on it before assuming. If you're not ready to assume: just introduce them for the first time like they've never met (obviously discression where needed, here.)</li>
            <li>Characters will form relationships to each other over time. Check in with RP partners at major plot points in relationships so that you're both on the same page.</li>
            <li>Don't be afraid of setting boundaries where you need to. This will prevent weird character black holes later on.</li>
            <li>This is even more important for enemies. Make sure every primary party is on board.</li>
         </ul>

    <li><h4> Scenarios</h4></li>
        <ul>
            <li>It's generally presumed that a scenario won't include topics that are common triggers unless this is consistent in the canon (violence, for example, in violent canon is usually expected to an extent.)</li>
            <li>If you're not sure if something could be a serious common trigger - check with an admin. If you'll be using scenes that contain coerciveness or extreme violence on a victim: All parties need to consent.</li>
            <li>The reader in a public RP is <strong>ALSO </strong>a party. If you're in a D&D campaign, every player is a party member. If you're running a public RP blog: every reader is a party. Where it's not possible to accomodate all of that, you TW(Trigger Warning) like your life depends on it and obscure it from whoever doesn't want to have it as part of canon. This is VERY important.</li>
            <li><strong>18+</strong> scenarios require consistent, continued, real consent from all parties. The reader in a public RP is ALSO a party.</li>
            <li>Discord servers are public RP - anyone can join, and the conversations are not between a very small group.</li>
         </ul>

    <li><h4> Etiquette</h4></li>
        <ul>
            <li>At any time, a party can ask for a pause, a rewind, or a fade to black. Some RP people don't offer this, which is stupid as fuck.</li>
            <li>Your ability to separate out the actions of your character and yourself / their character and themselves are both <strong> EXPECTED </strong>and <strong>IMPLIED</strong>. This doesn't mean it's not okay to stop RP at any point, but moreso that it's expected you're not imposing a character's personality onto their player. Some players are playing assholes. This does not mean they are an asshole.</li>
            <li>If the vibe doesn't check: step back, inform parties, be polite, be kind. Consent and communication is the backbone of good RP.</li>
            <li>Be mindful of your skill level. Out of your depth? Ask someone. Overwhelmed? Say something. Need advice? Ask for it. RP is not just an activity; it's a skill.</li>
            <li>If you're doing private RP: draw your boundaries. You are responsible for your conduct. Consent is not assumed in roleplay; it's consistently requested.</li>
        </ul>
</ol>
